      "content": "S&P Global Ratings foresees a resilient performance in 2023 among corporate and infrastructure companies in the GCC countries, despite higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. However, S&P expects that higher interest rates and inflation, and less-accommodating debt capital markets relative to 2021, will represent some challenges for the GCC companies in 2023, alongside its expectation of slower economic growth. ‘Despite this, we still forecast resilient performance, given stable earnings profiles, strong balance-sheets, and healthy funding and maturity profiles. We therefore expect GCC corporate and infrastructure issuers to comfortably navigate through 2023,’ S&P said in its GCC Corporate and Infrastructure Outlook 2023 Report. After a sharp recovery in 2022, the rating agency expects to see slower GDP growth among the GCC countries in 2023, largely because of OPEC-related oil production cuts. However, its oil price assumptions remain relatively high, with the Brent oil price averaging US$90 per barrel in 2023 and US$80 in 2024. Hydrocarbon prices in 2023 and 2024 should support intrinsic credit quality for the oil and gas sector in the region, it added. ‘As such, we do not expect a significant negative impact on non-oil GDP and corporate sector performance. We also expect some negative – but manageable – earnings impact from higher global and local interest rates, while inflation could affect profitability margins for some of the regional operators,’ S&P noted. The rating agency said that most companies exhibit a balanced debt composition with about half of their funding exposed to floating interest rates, and the rest based on fixed rates. ‘However, a handful of companies have higher floating rate exposure, making them more vulnerable to further interest hikes, especially for those operating in cyclical industries that may suffer from economic headwinds.’ S&P said, ‘Rated GCC corporate issuers operate with healthy and stable revenue generation that should allow them to digest manageable increases in cost of funds as well as the impact of inflation on their margins, while their healthy maturity profiles should allow them to navigate through capital market conditions that remain less favourable than in 2021.’ Similarly, the rating agency said its rated infrastructure projects’ operational performances are expected to remain robust and to generate strong cash flow to fully service or repay all their respective senior debts. As per S&P, GCC corporates’ operating performance accelerated in 2022 accompanied by positive rating actions, largely thanks to improvements in the regional oil and gas-based economies. In the meantime, some rated government-related entities also saw positive rating actions following similar actions on several rated sovereigns in the region. ‘As a result, 75 per cent of our rating outlooks are stable, while over 20 per cent are on a positive outlook, which reflects our expectations of resilience for the rated corporate and infrastructure issuers in 2023,’ S&P added. The rating agency does not expect rated GCC infrastructure issuers to refinance their long-term debt given the high interest rate environment. ‘Similarly, we have seen a slowdown over 2022 for infrastructure first-time issuers, which we foresee recovering progressively over the course of 2023-2024 as long-term borrowing rates stabilize.’",

Dbeibah was quick to affirm his support for the UN envoy's roadmap following the latter's press conference on Saturday morning. \"We renew our support for Bathily's efforts, and we commend the response of the United Nations to our request to raise the level of coordination and support for conducting elections,\" the PM stated on his Facebook account Saturday. He urged Libyans to demonstrate \"a strong will\" to end the transitional stages through fair elections, adding that his government shares the disappointment of the international community of the legislative bodies in Libya for \"failing\" to agree on the voting rules. \"The UN envoy’s description of their procrastination -the HoR and HCS- as having agreed not to agree, is consistent with our position from the outset that the hindering of the elections is due to the legislative bodies’ failure to find implementable laws.\"",

      "description": "A quick whistle erases an apparent Americans winner, but Reese Belton scores on the subsequent penalty shot to win it anyway.",
      "content": "The Portland Winterhawks lost to the Tri-City Americans 3-2 in overtime in a game in which Portland was the better team but were beaten by goalie Tomas Suchanek standing on his head. But that’s not what will be remembered. In overtime: Some of this is speculation. Either no announcement was made, or if it was it was impossible to hear in a building where you can’t hear the PA when the crowd is loud. No official explanation has come out yet, although it might at some point. The gist of it is that it probably was an officiating mistake, maybe an understandable one at this level with so much going on during the play, but it turned out correctly anyway. There are fans who left when Mechura put the puck in who probably right now have no idea that the game was restarted, and, if they don’t follow the team closely, will never know. In any event, it finished with a 3-2 Tri-City win in overtime. Suchanek stopped 47 of 49 for the win. The Americans trying for a bonus win in their attempt to beat Everett for 5th in the conference. Portland trying for a successful road weekend, and trying to finally wrap up 5th in the conference. An even period up to the point Tri-City got the power play goal. At which point it was totally dominated by the Winterhawks. 14-2 after the goal, and a lot of good chances, but Suchanek stopped everything. Should have been at least 1-1. And it looked like it was 1-1 on a tip by Luke Schelter, but it was ruled on video review that he deflected it with a high stick. Not as dominant as in the 1st, but after an even start Portland got it going again. Suchanek started giving up rebounds but they bounced past Winterhawks. Then a disastrous line change near the end of the period, and they’re down 2. The Ams played their best period but gave up two to tie it anyway, on Dragicevic’s broken stick for Nguyen’s shorthanded goal and then Schelter finally making Tri-City pay for an open look from the slot. Chaos. Suchanek. No. The Ams missed top scorers Jake Sloan and Ethan Ernst. They played better than they did in their Friday win over Spokane. Overall, 3 points out of 4 for the weekend is about the level at which they played, and for a road trip can be considered a success. Their magic number is 1 point to clinch 3rd in the conference. With 4 out of the last 6 against Seattle, make it to 40 wins is going to be a chore. They continue to rely a whole lot on Suchanek. A big win, giving them a 2-point advantage for Everett for 5th. Both have the same number of games, and both have relatively similar schedules against the conference’s bottom ranked teams. Tuesday vs. Spokane, 7pm Friday at Seattle, 7pm Saturday vs. Seattle, 6pm Friday 3/31, probable Game 1 of the playoffs",

      "content": "Muhammad Menfi, Chairman of the Presidential Council (PC), has renewed his continued support for the UN envoy, Abdoulaye Bathily, appreciating his efforts to achieve Libyan-led parliamentary and presidential elections by the end of 2023. Menfi pledged to implement the UN's road map, the Berlin outputs, and the recommendations and decisions of the Security Council. To set the course for free and fair elections, he vowed to facilitate political neutrality, preserve Libya’s sovereignty, security, and oil stability, and push for unifying its sovereign and economic institutions. He also reaffirmed his government's continued coordination with the international community, neighboring countries, and all Libyan political forces to complete the entitlements of the preliminary stage based on reconciliation and the unification of institutions. On Saturday, Bathily held a press conference disclosing his vision for implementing elections in Libya, suggesting to form a high-level committee of Libyan parties for this purpose. If the electoral laws are put in place in June, elections can be held at the end of this year, the UN envoy says, adding that in the remaining seven months, the two councils, the HoR and HCS, should agree on and finalize the electoral laws, as he urged the establishment of a peaceful environment for the elections. He said the two Councils have a chance to regain their confidence by pushing their teams in the 6+6 joint committee to adhere to the new roadmap timeframe.",

      "content": "A former governor of Sokoto State , Aliyu Wamakko, has appealed to the electorate in the state to be peaceful as they troop to polling units to cast their votes in Saturday’s Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections. The elections were initially scheduled for 11 March but were later postponed to 18 March by INEC. The shift in date, according to INEC, was to enable the commission to reconfigure the BVAS machines it used for the 25th February presidential and national assembly elections. Mr Wamakko, now a senator on the platform of the APC, in a special message to the people of the state, said peace is the prerequisite of any meaningful development. “Without peace and harmony, development and socio-economic prosperity will continue to elude us. “Our topmost priority should be the sustenance of peace, unity and the spirit of good neighbourliness,” the former Governor of Sokoto State said. Mr Wamakko said that violence would not do anybody any good, as it is destructive and retrogressive. He said: “Nobody should perpetrate violence in the name of politics, hence we should all uphold the sanctity of human life. “God gives and takes leadership to whosoever He wishes and at his appointed time. “So, we should all go out peacefully on Saturday and cast our votes for our preferred candidates.” Mr Wammako, who was governor of Sokoto State between 2007 and 2015, is the leader of the opposition APC in the North-west state.

      "description": "The ban on natural gas infrastructure by the Eugene City Council will have a very limited impact on greenhouse gas emissions, won't get gas out of the power supply and may increase the cost of building housing, the editorial board writes.",
      "content": "The Eugene City Council didn’t want voters to decide whether the city should ban natural gas hookups in new homes. It wasn’t a question for them to resolve, the council concluded. Unfortunately, the council majority failed to realize that it wasn’t something they should determine either. Instead of letting the people who will build and buy these homes decide whether to install gas stoves, furnaces or fireplaces, the Eugene City Council infrastructure in new low-rise residential construction. With this vote, said Mayor Lucy Vinis, in Oregon on building for the future. Councilmember Jennifer Yeh have been looking for leaders to take action on climate change. “We have to start moving,” she said. “And this is that movement.” That’s a lot of self-congratulation for a change with very limited impact. The that banning such residential hookups would let the city avoid growth of 0.12% in natural gas usage annually. That’s hardly the kind of dramatic change that should motivate other communities to follow suit, although Milwaukie is developing its own proposal. But the ban has motivated opponents who appear to have gathered enough signatures to refer the ordinance to the November ballot. They need 6,460 signatures from registered voters to qualify; last Thursday, they submitted nearly 13,000. Voters apparently will have a say on the ban, after all, but opponents can now add government overreach to the argument against it. Many communities are rightly exploring how to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopt cleaner sources of energy as the impacts of climate change intensify. Electrification is a key element of that strategy, both in transportation and building infrastructure. And supporters of the ban aren’t incorrect that , which has a lot to lose if more communities adopt Eugene’s approach, is funding the opposition campaign. But that doesn’t alter the obligation for communities to make meaningful change that weighs the emissions reduction against other critical factors, including cost, the ability of the electrical system to meet increasing need and impacts to other urgent priorities – like building more housing in a housing crisis. Such considerations are particularly key when the government mandates action as opposed to incentivizing change. Unfortunately for Eugene, the passage of the ban smells more of symbolic posturing than thoughtful policy. Even one city councilor who voted for the ban, Alan Zelenka, of the council’s approach. “It’s not part of a well-thought out strategy on how to proceed,” he said at the Feb. 6 meeting. “It might be different if this action would result in big huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but it doesn’t.” It’s important to note that banning gas hookups is not the same as eliminating natural gas as a power source. Even in Eugene, where the Eugene Water & Electric Board relies primarily on hydropower, the utility still needs to buy electricity produced by natural-gas power plants to meet demand, particularly during winter peaks. The utility also made clear in its that natural gas will continue to be part of the mix as it integrates more renewable forms of energy. And even as demand is expected to increase significantly in the 2030s, uncertainty looms over the future of hydropower, the ability to transmit wind and solar power and the volatility of costs, the utility noted. Getting gas out of homes does not mean an easy path to clean energy by a longshot. Homebuilders also dispute some Eugene City Councilors’ assertion that all-electric home construction is cheaper than electric plus gas. Even factoring in gas infrastructure expenses, the cost of a gas furnace was cheaper by nearly $6,000 to $8,000 than the cost of a heat pump that could do the same job, said Mike Erdmann, executive director of the Home Builders Association of Marion & Polk Counties, who based his assessment on reports from two HVAC contractors. Making housing more expensive when Oregon is in the midst of a housing crisis doesn’t make much sense. That said, Eugene isn’t a hotbed of new construction anyway. According to the city’s planning website, the city issued permits for only 970 new apartments and homes in 2022. Meanwhile, a national report by Up for Growth last year showed the city has a housing shortage of more than 6,500 units. The Eugene City Council might want to consider focusing more on encouraging housing than passing a ban that generates little but bragging rights. Eugene City Council could have led the way by offering incentives and explaining why electrification is a good choice to consider while still respecting individuals’ right to choose for themselves. in recent years show exactly why someone might want gas stoves and fireplaces – and even gas furnaces, with a generator – to keep warm and fed when the electricity is out. Assuming county elections officials confirm that the ordinance will be on the November ballot, it will be up to Eugene residents to decide whether to be the guinea pigs on this new front. But other Oregon communities who recognize that substance matters more than symbolism should stay on the sidelines.",

      "content": "Gardening season is on its way and you may have . To ask one, simply go to the , type in your question and include the county where you live. A photo is very helpful. Q: When do I prune clematis that blooms in the spring and one that blooms late summer? – Benton County A: Clematis are such beautiful additions to a garden. The best pruning practices for clematis are dependent upon the specific variety that you have. Each variety of clematis is either a Group A or 1, Group B or 2, or Group C or 3. Early blooming, small flowers on old growth are likely Group A/1. Early blooming, large flowers on old growth are likely Group B/2. Blooms that appear on new growth are likely to be Group C/3. lists the different clematis varieties and which group they belong to. The handout also briefly touches on clematis care, including pruning. describes some of the different varieties to help you identify which type you might have. It also has some good information on how specifically to prune. Hopefully these sites will help you identify which type of clematis you have, which can inform how and when to prune. – Karen Mills, OSU Extension Master Gardener Q: Are pansies good for very early bee food or not? I have bees coming out now but none of my native plants are blooming yet. I find articles with differing opinions about this. Mostly I’d like to know what I can plant for the bees that will bloom this early. – Lane County A: If you watch your hive entrance you will notice that the bees are bringing in pollen. They are very resourceful at finding food sources. The plants/shrubs/trees that you want for early bloom are perennials as the annuals are not really blooming yet. OSU Extension has a very detailed publication called, ” This is a very comprehensive publication that will provide all the information you need to provide an expanded diet for honey bees as well as for native bees. Notice that right under the tab where you can choose either a PDF or the online version a note about supplemental files that are pollinator garden designs. Look at them. They are really cool and sure to get you excited about adding to your landscape. – Anna Ashby, OSU Extension Master Gardener Q: I grew this tuber from seed in a 4-inch pot, which is why it is so clumped together. It appears to either have a ton of eyes that are sprouting or something is wrong with it. I’ve not seen this many eyes on such a young tuber before. I did transplant it late in the season to remove it from its pot and put it in a section of the garden with other seedling “keepers.” This is the only tuber that looks like this. It is currently stored in my garage away from the other tubers until I know what’s going on with it. – Clackamas County A: Dahlias are susceptible to gall, so it’s a valid concern. However, some varieties of dahlias can sprout vigorously from the top and still be completely healthy. I would continue to keep it separate for now and watch the sprouts closely as they develop. Are they deformed, or do they appear to be growing straight upward with normal girth and leaf formation? The sprouts formed by crown or leaf gall will be twisted, bulbous, or otherwise misshapen. If you were to plant the bulb, most of them would not rise above the surface of the soil. I would try watching these sprouts develop for a while longer. If they are all growing upward and appear normal and healthy, you might just have a particularly vigorous bulb. If they appear twisted and abnormally shaped or extremely dense, then you should discard the bulbs somewhere other than your compost pile. If, after watching the sprouts develop a bit more, you are still uncertain, it is safest to discard the bulb since gall is highly contagious. I know that sometimes people are attached to particular varieties, especially if they are discontinued or hard to re-acquire. If that is the case, you might try planting the bulb this spring in a container where you can keep an eye on it and avoid soil contamination. You will know definitively when you pull back the soil after the greens have emerged and grown a bit – a mass of twisted growth beneath the soil indicates leaf gall. Then it’s really time to toss the whole thing, including the soil in your container. Be sure to sanitize your container and any digging tools you used to avoid further contamination.

      "description": "Cannabis is a billion-dollar industry in the state.",
      "content": "Oregon marijuana prices are at an all-time low. Median retail prices fell to $4 a gram at the start of 2023, according to state regulators, off 16% from a year earlier. Last year’s decline continues a long downward trajectory that has reduced prices by more than half in the seven years since recreational marijuana became legal in Oregon. “The Oregon recreational marijuana market is in arguably the weakest economic position it has been in since the inception of the program in 2016,” the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission wrote in last month. Falling prices are great for consumers who weary of inflation’s effects on most other products, but abysmal for Oregon retailers and growers. State economists warned last month that tax collections are below forecasts. That’s not just because falling prices have reduced the state’s cut — amid the steep decline, struggling cannabis businesses are “ .” Oregon collects a little more than $150 million in marijuana tax revenue annually. The industry’s deepening troubles are a notable development, given that Oregon’s cannabis market has grown into a $1 billion market. “We have a record amount of overdue accounts receivable, retailers that owe us money,” said Mason Walker, CEO of East Fork Cultivars, which farms cannabis in Josephine County. “That’s happening across the market. It’s causing pain up and down the supply chain.” The reason prices keep falling is Economics 101: Supply is much higher than demand. Marijuana grows abundantly in Oregon. But cannabis remains prohibited under federal law and can’t be sold, legally, across state lines. And while cannabis has proven increasingly popular, the state’s 4.2 million residents consume only a fraction of the marijuana the state’s farmers grow. The OLCC estimates Oregon cannabis demand was just 63% of supply last year. Sales in 2022 fell by more than 17% to $994 million, the Oregon industry’s first-ever annual decline. Production is dropping, too, as farmers respond to falling prices. But supply and demand are far from balanced. Farmers produced less cannabis last year, as it became clear the surge in demand that accompanied the pandemic wouldn’t continue. But state regulators say there’s another problem for retailers and growers – large stocks of inventory left over from prior years. That could hold prices down indefinitely. “These low consumer prices force businesses to operate under low margins and extreme pressure,” the OLCC wrote in last month’s report. Some major cannabis companies have , among them Curaleaf, one of the nation’s largest marijuana businesses. “Those (exits) are very notable, and they leave a vacuum for the survivors to fill,” Walker said. Still, Walker said he doesn’t see any quick fix for his industry. Oregon stopped issuing new cannabis licenses last year in reaction to the supply issues, but Walker said that has had very little effect because so many licenses had been issued already. And while marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, more individual states have legalized it. Walker said that reduces spending by people who travel to Oregon to buy cannabis, some of whom used to buy enough to quietly take some home when they left. Oregon’s cannabis businesses have weathered hard times before, Walker said, most notably during a sharp decline in prices at the start of 2018. But he said the industry is coping with “fatigue” from the prolonged downturn, with a growing number of businesses giving up and selling their licenses for a fraction of what they had hoped. “It’s not a completely screwed up market,” Walker said, “but it’s challenging.” -- Mike Rogoway | | 503-294-7699",
